# Documents and templates

We have several handy templates that we use to get going quick on new work.

## Figma

[Helpers & Tooling](https://www.figma.com/files/project/12944215/Helpers-%26-Tooling?fuid=872030793297791611) project includes:
- [Project Template](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/Project-Template), which you can duplicate and use for all new Figma files. It includes some pages weâ€™ve found work well for supporting async work and Figma files as a source of truth:
  - [Cover:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=0%3A1) a project thumbnail used to recognising the files easier while browsing. Please, use the cover symbol for changing the stages (draft, in progress, done, deprecated) as the project progresses.
  - [Master:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=246%3A11) used for final, usually high-fidelity, mockups. The template showcased on this page can be used for grouping designs in bigger projects.
  - [Prototypes:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=262%3A11) used to separate interactive prototypes mockups that may include stages and variants that designers don't want to include in the main design pages. These prototypes can be actively used for usability testing. Please, be careful when making any changes.
  - [Wireframes:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=103%3A3) used for the low-fidelity mockups.
  - [Buddy review:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=260%3A11) used for reviewing the in-progress work by other team memebrs or designers.
  - [Playgroud:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=246%3A12) a place for the designer to store the exploratory or in-progress mockups that don't need to be reviewed.
  - [Redlines:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=291%3A227) used for optional detailed measurements. Use redlines only when absolutely necessary. It is not a recommended handoff method for the whole project.
  - [Responsive layouts:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=302%3A227) used for XS-L mockups based on [our grids](https://www.figma.com/file/8qNcDzOXLj1hcOM76WDPN9/?node-id=914%3A0). They apply not only to mobile devices. It's a common use case to view Soucegraph in 1/2 or 1/3 browser window on desktop as well.
  - [QA:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=291%3A228) used to facilitate the communication between designer and developer during the design QA of the implementation. You can add screenshots and annotations to explain what corrections you're requesting. Remember to add link to page to the PR.
  - [Archives:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=291%3A229) used for past designs, not needed in the review process.
  - [Research:](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/?node-id=246%3A13) used for research-related artifacts.
- [Basic Project Template](https://www.figma.com/file/YYEGdPNU4zirLS0uWfoYWW/Basic-Project-Template?node-id=0%3A1), which you can duplicate and use for smaller issues. It includes only essential pages: cover, master, buddy review and playground.
- Project card
- [Figma Basics for Sourcegraphers](https://www.figma.com/file/JH7GVilasQ11c9DdjpZUIF/Figma-for-Sourcegraphers-Part-1) and [Intro to designing with Wildcard DS](https://www.figma.com/file/DrlzSZOwHqIgmpHwMqCWOs/Intro-to-designing-with-Wildcard-DS), which introduce Figma and how we use it in design to anyone who may not be familiar with it.

## Docs

- [RFC template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUp1A-j5xxnPn_rv3x3rWo8tbXJhIA5NggHLU6UofUc/edit?usp=sharing), which you should duplicate for all new RFCs.
- [One-page research plan template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14xwjn7y6H5JbJEFOqNtlZD54u6etUZt_oHrOHLwmrtg/edit?usp=sharing), which you can use to plan research.
- [One-page design challenge template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sEAZAl4NXTY5R1aklPv70_gg-ASbQDgqy0bT5fnJhoU/edit?usp=sharing), which you can use to frame a design problem.

## Airtable

- [User testing insights template](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invIqYSM6f67GU0cQ&inviteToken=56433326c701d77869d29d1fb9ba52b6d90217d1d610b78366d884babaa020b2&utm_source=email), which you can use to handle data and insights from user research.
